## Modpack Information in MineColab

**Modpacks** are collections of **mods, configurations, and resources** pre-packaged to modify Minecraft comprehensively.  
Their goal is to provide a complete and coherent experience without installing each mod individually.

### What You Should Know:

1. **Server Compatibility:**  
   - Each modpack is designed for a **specific Minecraft version** and server type.  
   - Installing an incompatible modpack may **cause errors or operational issues**.

2. **Compatible Server Platforms:**  
- Forge  
- Fabric  
- NeoForge  
- Arclight  
- Mohist  
- Banner  

3. **Modpack Structure:**  
   - They may include:  
     - Mods  
     - Plugins  
     - Resourcepacks  
     - Datapacks  
     - Custom configurations  

4. **Caution with Client Mods:**  
   - Some modpacks include **client-side mods** that do not work on servers.  
   - Attempting to use them on the server may cause errors or connection issues.  
   - For more information, see the [client vs. server mod documentation](/minecolab/guide/mods-plugins/info/mod-info).

- Always check the **Minecraft version and server type** before using a modpack.
