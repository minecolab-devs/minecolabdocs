## How to Change or Add a Token

<img src="/assets/images/celdas/token_change.png" alt="token_change" />

1. Make sure you have run your server at least once to initialize the configuration.  
2. Open the cell **Change Tunnel Token**.  
3. Select the tunnel service in **`tunnel_service`**.  
4. Enter your token in the requested field.  
   - If you don’t know how to configure a token, check the specific documentation for each tunnel:
      - [Ngrok](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-ngrok)  
      - [Zrok](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-zrok)  
      - [PlayIt.gg](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-playit)  
      - [LocalToNet](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-localtonet)  
      - [Tailscale](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-tailscale)  
      - [Minekube Gate](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-minekube-gate)
      
5. If no token is entered, the script will show an error and will not save changes.  
6. Once entered, the token is automatically saved in MineColab’s configuration.

## Completion

Done! The tunnel token has been successfully updated.  

- Check that the selected tunnel is active using the **Change Tunnel Service** cell.  
- If something doesn’t work, re-enter the token and save the changes.  
- If you don’t know how to configure a token, consult the specific documentation for each service.  

The server is now ready to use the tunnel with authentication.
