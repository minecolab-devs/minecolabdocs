## Minekube Tunnel Configuration

<img src="/assets/images/celdas/cel_minekube.png" alt="cel_minekube" />

MineColab allows you to expose your Minecraft server through **Minekube-Gate**, which requires specific configuration in `config.yml`.  
With this cell, you can **update the name or endpoint** of the Minekube tunnel easily and safely.

:::caution
The active tunnel must be **Minekube-Gate**.  
:::

## How to Update the Name/Endpoint

1. Open the **Minekube Tunnel Config** cell.  
2. If the active tunnel is **Minekube-Gate**, you will be prompted to enter a **name or endpoint** for your tunnel.  
3. Enter the desired value and press Enter.  
   - This value will be used both as the name and endpoint in `config.yml`.  
4. The script automatically updates the `connect` section of the YAML file:  

    ```yaml
    connect:
      enabled: true
      name: <entered_value>
      endpoint: <entered_value>
    ```

5. You will see a confirmation message indicating that the configuration has been updated successfully.

:::note
If the active tunnel is not **Minekube-Gate**, the script will not make changes and will display an informative message.  
This configuration ensures that your Minecraft server can connect correctly via Minekube-Gate using the desired name/endpoint.
:::

## Completion

Done! The name and endpoint of the Minekube tunnel have been successfully updated.

  * To activate the Minekube tunnel, **it is necessary to run this cell**.

  * If you don’t know how to find or configure your endpoint, you can visit the [Minekube Tunnel documentation](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-minekube-gate).

  * Your server will be accessible via Minekube-Gate using the new configuration.

  * Everything is done safely without affecting other tunnels or server settings.
