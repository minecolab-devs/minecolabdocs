## How to Change the Tunnel Service

<img src="/assets/images/celdas/tunnels_change.png" alt="tunnels_change" />

1. Make sure you have run your server at least once to initialize the configuration.  
2. Open the cell **Change Tunnel Service**.  
3. Select the tunnel service you want to use in **`tunnel_service`**:  
   - `"Leave as it is"` → Keeps the current tunnel.  
   - `"ngrok"`, `"argo"`, `"zrok"`, `"playit"`, `"localtonet"`, `"tailscale"`, `"minekube-gate"`  
4. Save the changes; the script will automatically update the tunnel configuration.  
5. Restart the server if necessary to activate the new tunnel.  

## Access the specific configuration for each tunnel

If you don’t know how to configure each tunnel, check the specific documentation:  

- [Ngrok](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-ngrok)  
- [Zrok](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-zrok)  
- [PlayIt.gg](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-playit)  
- [LocalToNet](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-localtonet)  
- [Tailscale](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-tailscale)  
- [Minekube Gate](/minecolab/guide/tunnel/tunnel-configuration/tunnel-minekube-gate)

## Completion

Done! Your Minecraft server is now using the new tunnel.  

- Check that the tunnel is active before sharing your server.  
- If something doesn’t work, go back to the **Change Tunnel Service** cell and select another tunnel.  

Your server is ready to play and share.
