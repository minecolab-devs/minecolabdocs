:::caution
To use the token with TCP tunnels, you need to add a valid credit card as part of the identity verification process.  
Ngrok requires this step to prevent abuse and ensure secure access to TCP services.

## Setting up Ngrok with MineColab

When selecting Ngrok as your tunnel provider, follow these steps to configure it correctly:

### Enter your authentication token

When you select **Ngrok** in MineColab, you will be asked for an **authentication token**. You will see a message like this:

```log
[ LOG ] Chosen Tunnel service: Ngrok
[ LOG ] Tunnel Settings:
[ LOG ] Get your authtoken from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
[ WARN ] Remember to paste the whole authtoken at once!
Authtoken:
```

### How to get your token

1. Go to <a href="https://ngrok.com" target="_blank">Ngrok</a> and create an account (if you don’t have one yet).  
2. Once logged in, go to your **Dashboard** and navigate to the **Your Authtoken** section.  
3. Copy the token shown there.

Once you have the token, paste it directly on the next line inside MineColab:

```log
Authtoken:
```
### Select your tunnel region

After entering your token, MineColab will ask you to choose a **region** for your server:

```log
Select a region:
• ap - Asia/Pacific (Singapore)
• au - Australia (Sydney)
• eu - Europe (Frankfurt - Germany)
• in - India (Mumbai)
• jp - Japan (Tokyo)
• sa - America (São Paulo - Brazil)
• us - United States (Ohio)
```
If everything is correct, you will see something like this:

```log
[ LOG ] Token saved: *************************************************
[ LOG ] Downloading your_software.jar
[ LOG ] Completed!
```
## Starting the server

Once everything is configured (server name, software, Minecraft version, tunnel provider, and authentication token), it’s time to **start the server**.

Go to the cell: **🛑 Console > Run your server** and execute it. <img src="/assets/images/celdas/console.png" alt="Console" />

MineColab will start the server boot process. You will see console logs indicating that the server is running:

```log
[ LOG ] Colab Version: x.x.x
/content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/ngrok
[ LOG ] [Note: Downloading essentials files takes approximately 10-15 minutes. Please wait a little, then 
restart the console.]
[ LOG ] Directory /content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/logs created
[ LOG ] Directory /content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/ngrok/tunnel created
OpenJDK x was installed successfully.
[ LOG ] Running server once to generate needed files...
[ LOG ] Initial setup complete.
[ LOG ] Accepting Eula.
[ LOG ] Files:

[ LOG ] Directory /content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/logs created
[ LOG ] Directory /content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/ngrok/tunnel created
OpenJDK x was installed successfully.
[ LOG ] Starting server (ngrok)...
[ LOG ] Stop server => /stop
Authtoken saved to configuration file: /root/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    Use the following IPs to access your server                    |
|    -------------------------------------------                    |
|    Java: Your server address is x.tcp.ngrok.io:xxxxx               |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
Here you will see your **server IP** to connect from Minecraft.

### Server online

Once your server is fully running, you will see something like this:

```log
[ LOG ] Starting:
.
.
.
[00:00:00 INFO]: Done (xx.xxxs)! For help, type "help"
```
Done, your server is now online.  
Use the IP address shown in the console to connect from Minecraft.

With this, you have finished setting up your server with **Ngrok** in MineColab.  
You can now invite your friends and start playing.
