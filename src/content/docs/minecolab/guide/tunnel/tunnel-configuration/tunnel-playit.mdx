When selecting Playit as your tunnel provider, follow these steps to configure it correctly:

### Enter your authentication Secret Key

When you select **PlayIt** in MineColab, you will be asked for a **Secret Key**. You will see a message like this:

```log
[ LOG ] Chosen Tunnel service: PlayIt
[ LOG ] PlayIt Tunnel Settings:
[ LOG ] Get your Secret Key from https://playit.gg/account/agents/new-docker
[ WARN ] Remember to paste the whole Secret Key at once!
Secret Key :
```

### How to get your token

1. Go to <a href="https://playit.gg/account/agents/new-docker" target="_blank">Playit</a> and create an account (if you don’t have one yet).  
2. Once logged in, you will see something like this; click **Create a new docker based agent**.

3. Give the agent a name.

4. This is where your Secret Key will appear.

Once you have the Secret Key, paste it directly on the next line inside MineColab:

```log
Secret Key:
```

If everything is correct, you will see something like this:

```log
[ LOG ] Secret Key saved in settings.
[ LOG ] Downloading server.jar
[ LOG ] Completed!
```

## Starting the server

Once everything is configured —server name, software, Minecraft version, tunnel provider, and authentication token— it’s time to **start the server**.

Go to the cell: **🛑 Console > Run your server** and execute it. <img src="/assets/images/celdas/console.png" alt="Console" />

MineColab will start the server boot process. You will see console logs indicating that the server is running:

```log
[ LOG ] Colab Version: 0.3.2
/content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/PRUEBAKEYS2
[ LOG ] [Note: Downloading essentials files takes approximately 10-15 minutes. Please wait for a little bit, then 
restart the console.]
[ LOG ] Directory /content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/logs created
[ LOG ] Directory /content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/PRUEBAKEYS2/tunnel created
OpenJDK 17 was installed successfully.
[ LOG ] Running server once to generate needed files...
[ LOG ] Initial setup complete.
[ LOG ] Accepting Eula.
[ LOG ] Files:

[ LOG ] Directory /content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/logs created
[ LOG ] Directory /content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/PRUEBAKEYS2/tunnel created
OpenJDK 17 was installed successfully.
[ LOG ] Starting server (playit)...
[ LOG ] Stop server => /stop
/usr/local/bin/playit
[ LOG ] Logging in with existing Playit Secret Key.
[ LOG ] Starting Playit:
[ LOG ] Playit Connected
```

When you see this message in the console:

```log
[ LOG ] Playit Connected
```

You can now create a tunnel in your agent, it should look like this. <img src="/assets/images/playit/cone-agent.png" alt="Connect Agent" />

### Start tunnel configuration

Clicking on the agent, you will see this: <img src="/assets/images/playit/agent-tunel.png" alt="Tunnel Agent" />

You will see the option to create a tunnel. Click **Create Tunnel**.

Select the type of tunnel you want to create, depending on the server type you set up (Java or Bedrock).

Click **Add Tunnel** to confirm and finish the setup.

<img src="/assets/images/playit/agregar-tunel.png" alt="Add Tunnel" />  

After adding the tunnel, your public IP address will be displayed, which is the IP you can use to join your server.  
Additionally, you will see a link generated by Playit which is also valid to join your server.

With that done, return to **MineColab** to check if the tunnel configuration was saved correctly.

### Server online

Now just wait for the server to finish fully starting.

```log
[ LOG ] Starting:
.
.
.
[00:00:00 INFO]: Done (xx.xxxs)! For help, type "help"
```

Done, your server is now **online**.  
Use the IP address generated by Playit to connect from Minecraft.

With this, you have finished setting up your server with **Playit** in **MineColab**.  
You can now invite your friends and start playing.
