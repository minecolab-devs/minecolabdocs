## Configure LocaltoNet with MineColab

When selecting LocaltoNet as your tunnel provider, follow these steps to configure it correctly:

### Enter your authentication token

When you select **LocaltoNet** in MineColab, you will be asked for an **authentication token**. You will see a message like this:

```log
[ LOG ] Chosen Tunnel service: LocaltoNet
[ LOG ] Tunnel Settings:
[ LOG ] Get your authtoken from https://localtonet.com/usertoken
[ WARN ] Remember to paste the whole authtoken at once!
Authtoken:
````

To complete this step, you need to obtain your token from the LocaltoNet website.

### How to get your token

1. Go to <a href="https://localtonet.com" target="_blank">LocaltoNet</a> and create an account (if you don’t have one yet).  
2. Access your **Dashboard**.

   * Once logged in, in the main menu you will see the option **My Tokens**. Click there to manage your tokens.  
   * In the section that appears, you will find a field called **Token Name**. Here you should enter a descriptive name to identify your token (for example: *MineColab* or *Server1*).  
   * After entering the name, click the **Create** button.  
   * The system will process the request and, after a few seconds, your new token will appear in the table below, under the **TOKEN** column.  
   * Copy the full token from that column, as you will need it in MineColab.

Once you have the token, paste it directly on the next line inside MineColab:

```log
Authtoken:
```

If everything is correct, you will see something like this:

```log
[ LOG ] Token saved: *************************************************
[ LOG ] Downloading your_software.jar
[ LOG ] Completed!
```

## Starting the server

Once everything is configured (server name, software, Minecraft version, tunnel provider, and authentication token), it’s time to **start the server**.

Go to the cell: **🛑 Console > Run your server** and execute it. <img src="/assets/images/celdas/console.png" alt="Console" />  
MineColab will start the server boot process, and you will see console logs confirming it is running.

### Create and activate the tunnel in LocaltoNet

Once the console has started, the necessary LocaltoNet dependencies will be downloaded automatically.  
When this process finishes, you will see a message like this:

```log
[ LOG ] LocaltoNet tunnel started!  
Start the UDP_TCP connection on the dashboard: https://localtonet.com/tunnel/tcpudp
```

At that link (<a href="https://localtonet.com/tunnel/tcpudp" target="_blank">[https://localtonet.com/tunnel/tcpudp](https://localtonet.com/tunnel/tcpudp)</a>) you can configure your tunnel.

#### Steps to create the tunnel

1. Click **Create TCP - UDP Tunnel**.  
2. Select the type of tunnel according to your server:

   * **TCP** → for **Java Edition** servers.  
   * **UDP** → for **Bedrock Edition** servers.  
3. In **Auth Token**, select the token you created earlier.  
4. Choose the **region** you prefer (recommended is one near your location).  
5. In **Port**, enter your Minecraft server port:

   * **25565** → for **Java Edition**.  
   * **19132** → for **Bedrock Edition**.  
6. Other settings are optional.  
7. Click **Create** and wait a few seconds for your tunnel to appear.  
8. In the **URL** column, your server address will be displayed, but:

   * Initially, it will not be active.  
   * You will not see the **port** assigned until the tunnel is turned on.  
9. To activate it, go to the **Action** column and press the **Play** button ▶️.

   * Once turned on, the **URL** column will show the **full IP with port** (example: `2.tcp.localtonet.com:19132`).  
   * This is the information you need to connect from Minecraft.

### Server online

Once your server is fully turned on, you will see something like this in the console:

```log
[ LOG ] Starting:
.
.
.
[00:00:00 INFO]: Done (xx.xxxs)! For help, type "help"
```

At this point, your server is already online.  
Use the **connection address** shown in the **URL** column of LocaltoNet (including IP and port) to connect from Minecraft.

With this, you have finished setting up your server with **LocaltoNet** in MineColab.  
You can now invite your friends and start playing.
