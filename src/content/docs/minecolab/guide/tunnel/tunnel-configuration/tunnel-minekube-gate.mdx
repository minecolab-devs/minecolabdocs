## Configure Minekube Gate with MineColab

When selecting **Minekube Gate** as your tunnel provider, follow these steps to configure it correctly:

## Enter your authentication token

When you select **Minekube Gate** in MineColab, you will be asked for an **authentication token**.  
You will see a message like this:

```log
[ LOG ] Chosen Tunnel service: Minekube-Gate
[ LOG ] Tunnel Settings:
[ LOG ] Get your authtoken from https://app.minekube.com/orgs
[ WARN ] Remember to paste the whole authtoken at once!
Authtoken:
````

## How to get your token

1. Go to <a href="https://app.minekube.com" target="_blank">Minekube</a> and create an account (if you don’t have one yet).  
2. Click **Create or add Endpoint**.  
   - You can use the default name or assign a new one (for example: `mine-colab`).  
   - **Remember this name**, as it will be used later.  
3. Inside the **Endpoint** you created, go to the **Connectors** section and click the **Reset Token** button.  
4. The token will appear on screen; copy it to use in MineColab.

If everything is correct, you will see something like this in the console:

```log
[ LOG ] Token saved: *************************************************
[ LOG ] Downloading your_software.jar
[ LOG ] Completed!
```

## Starting the server

Once you have configured everything (server name, software, Minecraft version, tunnel, and token), it’s time to **start the server**.

Go to the cell: **🛑 Console > Run your server** and execute it. <img src="/assets/images/celdas/console.png" alt="Console" />  
MineColab will start the server boot process and display logs in the console.

---

### Waiting for tunnel activation

When booting is complete, you will see something like this:

```log
[ LOG ] Starting Gate
[ LOG ] Logging in with minekube token.
[ LOG ] Minekube gate connected successfully
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|     Use the following ip to access your shares        |
|     ------------------------------------------        |
|     xxxx-xxxx-XXX.play.minekube.net                   |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
[ LOG ] Playit startup
[ LOG ] No token in settings. Running playit setup
[ PLAYIT ] Visit link to setup https://playit.gg/claim/bxcxxxebbx
[ LOG ] Setup complete. Moving key to settings file
[ LOG ] Done.
[ LOG ] Starting Playit:
[ LOG ] Playit Connected
```
:::caution
The Minekube link shown is not directly functional yet.  
MineColab also activates Playit as a backup tunnel so the server remains accessible even if Minekube goes down.
:::

After this, wait for the server to finish booting:

```log
[ LOG ] Starting:
.
.
.
[00:00:00 INFO]: Done (xx.xxxs)! For help, type "help"
```
Once the **Done** message appears, the server has completed the initial boot.  
At this point, **you must stop the server** before continuing with final tunnel configuration or making any additional adjustments.

### Final tunnel configuration

Now go to **🌐 Tunneling options**.  
There you will find the cell **Minekube Tunnel Config**.

<img src="/assets/images/celdas/cel_minekube.png" alt="cel_minekube" />

1. Run the cell.  
2. You will be asked to enter the **Endpoint name** you previously created in Minekube.  
3. Enter the name correctly and confirm.  

If everything is correct, you will see something like this in the console:

```log
Enter the name/endpoint you want to use for Minekube: mine-colab
[ LOG ] [MINEKUBE] Configuration updated with value 'mine-colab' at: /content/drive/MyDrive/minecraft/myserver/tunnel/minekube-gate/config.yml
```

Go back to the cell: **🛑 Console > Run your server** and execute it.

---

### Server online

Once the tunnel configuration is complete and the Minekube cell is executed, your server will be **fully online**.

Here you will see your **server IP** to connect from Minecraft. This is the valid IP:

```log
[ LOG ] Starting Gate
[ LOG ] Logging in with minekube token.
[ LOG ] Minekube gate connected successfully
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|     Use the following ip to access your shares        |
|     ------------------------------------------        |
|     name-endpoint.play.minekube.net                   | 
+-------------------------------------------------------+
[ LOG ] Playit startup
[ LOG ] Done.
[ LOG ] Starting Playit:
[ LOG ] Playit Connected
```

Once your server is fully started, you will see:

```log
[ LOG ] Starting:
.
.
.
[00:00:00 INFO]: Done (xx.xxxs)! For help, type "help"
```

Your server is now **online**.  
Use the IP address shown in the console to connect from Minecraft.

With this, you have finished setting up your server with **Minekube Gate** in MineColab.  
You can now invite your friends and start playing.
