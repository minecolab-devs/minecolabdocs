## Tunnels

There are several tunnel services that allow you to expose your Minecraft server online without the need to manually open ports.  
Each one has its own features, limitations, and benefits.

## Available Tunnels

- **Ngrok**
- **PlayIt.gg**
- **Zrok**
- **LocalToNet**
- **Tailscale**
- **Minekube Gate**

---

## Common Limitations

Each tunnel provider has restrictions you should consider before choosing.

- **Ngrok**  
  The domain changes every time you restart (unless you use a paid plan).  
  Has limits on simultaneous connections and bandwidth.  
  Requires a credit card to use your token.

- **PlayIt.gg**  
  Assigns a public IP that usually remains the same as long as the configuration is preserved.  
  Some regions may experience moderate latency.
  
- **Zrok**  
  May require additional configuration.  
  Not fully optimized for real-time gaming.  
  Some regions may experience moderate latency.

- **LocalToNet**  
  The free plan has session limits.  
  Some regions may experience moderate latency.

- **Tailscale**  
  Requires client installation and authentication.  
  Works best in private network environments.  
  Some regions may experience moderate latency.

- **Minekube Gate**  
  Still in development.  
  May not be stable in all environments.  
  Some regions may experience moderate latency.
