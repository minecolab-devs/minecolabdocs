## ▶ or 🛑 Server Console

The console is the main tool to interact with your server in MineColab. From here, you can start the server, view real-time logs, and run administrative commands. Tunnel configurations and how to start the server from the console were explained in the **Tunnels** section.

### Pre-Startup Options

Before running the **Console > Run your server** cell, you will see the following options:

**Custom arguments (custom\_args)**

* If checked: you can write your own Java parameters (e.g., `-Xms2G -Xmx4G -XX:+UseG1GC`).
* If unchecked: MineColab will automatically apply the recommended default parameters.

**Auto update (Bedrock only)**

* If checked: the Bedrock server will automatically update when a new version is available.
  * This process may take 10–15 minutes.
  * The server will not be available during this time.
* If unchecked: the server will not auto-update.
  * You will decide when and how to apply updates manually.
  * This option does not affect Java servers.

### Server Startup

Once options are configured, run the **Console > Run your server** cell.  
MineColab will start the server and display the startup logs, including:

* Installation of required dependencies.
* Generation of initial files (EULA, world folders, configuration).
* Loading of plugins or mods (if installed).
* Confirmation that the server is online with the message:

```log
[00:00:00 INFO]: Done (xx.xxxs)! For help, type "help"
```

### Using Commands in the Console

You can type commands directly in the console while the server is running. Examples:

* `/stop` → Safely stops the server.
* `/op <player>` → Grants operator permissions to a player.
* `/whitelist add <player>` → Adds a player to the whitelist.
* `/say <message>` → Sends a global message to all connected players.

For a full list of Minecraft commands, refer to the official command documentation.

### Reading Logs

The console also shows real-time logs, which help you:

* Monitor player connections and disconnections.
* Identify server errors or warnings.
* Confirm plugins or mods loaded successfully.

### Customizing Java Parameters

If **Custom arguments** is enabled, you can adjust server performance using parameters like:

* `-Xms` → Minimum allocated memory (e.g., `-Xms2G`).
* `-Xmx` → Maximum allocated memory (e.g., `-Xmx4G`).
* `-XX:+UseG1GC` → Enables G1GC garbage collector for better performance with many players.
