## Server Custom

<img src="/assets/images/celdas/server_custom.png" alt="server_custom" />

MineColab allows you to personalize your Minecraft server with two main elements:

- **MOTD (Message of the Day)** → The message that appears in the Minecraft server list.  
- **Server icon** → The image displayed next to the server name in the server list.

## Changing the MOTD

1. Make sure you have run your server at least once (to generate the `server.properties` file).  
2. Open the customization cell (`Server_custom`) and select the **`server_motd`** option.  
3. Enter the text you want to display.  
   - You can use a generator like [MC Tools MOTD Creator](https://mctools.org/motd-creator) to add colors and formatting.  
4. Save the changes and restart your server to see the new MOTD in the Minecraft server list.

## Changing the Server Icon

1. Make sure you have a **square PNG image**.  
2. The image size should be **64x64 pixels** (MineColab will resize it automatically if needed).  
3. In the customization cell, select the **`server_icon`** option.  
4. There are two ways to add your icon:  
   - **Upload from your computer** → Use the upload button in the cell.  
   - **From a direct link** → Enter the URL of the image (you can upload it to services like [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com) or [Postimages](https://postimages.org) first).  
5. Once uploaded, the image will be resized to 64x64 px and saved as `server-icon.png` in your server folder.  
6. Restart your server to see the new icon in the Minecraft server list.

## Final Result

- The **MOTD** will appear below your server name.  
- The **icon** will appear to the left of the server name in the server list.
