## Server Properties Configuration

MineColab allows you to configure your Minecraft server easily and safely, ensuring important changes do not affect your existing worlds.  

## Modify Server Properties

You can change several server parameters without manually editing files:

- **Maximum number of players** → Limits how many players can join the server.  
- **Game mode** → Choose between Survival, Creative, Adventure, or Spectator.  
- **Difficulty** → Peaceful, Easy, Normal, or Hard.  
- **Advanced options** → PvP, command blocks, flight, spawn animals, monsters, villagers, Nether, and force gamemode.  
- **Allow non-premium players** → Enable or disable “cracked” mode.  

To change these properties:

1. Make sure you have run your server at least once to generate the `server.properties` file.  
2. Open the properties configuration cell.  
3. Adjust the parameters you want.  
4. Save the changes and restart your server to apply them.

## Change World Seed (Level Seed)

If you want to generate a new world with a specific seed:

1. Enter the seed in the **`LevelSeed`** option in the configuration cell.  
2. The script will automatically **backup existing worlds** to prevent data loss.  
3. Backed-up worlds are stored in a folder named with the date and seed used.  
4. After the backup, old worlds are deleted and a new world is generated with the specified seed.  

> This ensures you can experiment with new seeds without losing your current worlds.

### Automatic Backup

Each time the seed is changed:

- All existing worlds (`world`, `world_nether`, `world_the_end`) are detected.  
- Backups are created with the date and server name for easy recovery.  
- Original worlds are only deleted after the backup is completed.  

## Final Result

With this script you can:

- Safely adjust all key properties of your server.  
- Generate new worlds with any seed without losing existing worlds.
